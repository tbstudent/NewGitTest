<h1>ETHICS</h1>

	<h4><strong>Descriptive Morality:</strong></h4> <a href="https://online.vitalsource.com/#/books/1260042855/cfi/6/22!/4/52/2@0:59.4">Online book</a>

		<li>Refers to the actual practices of individuals and cultures and its beliefs about which behaviors are either good or bad.</li>

			<p> Example: A gang member might believe that it is right to avenge the killing of a fellow gang member with the killing of a rival gang member.</p>



	<h4><strong> Normative Ethics</strong></h4>

				<li>The attempt to identify identify and predict actions that ought to be produced by individuals that will inevitably be deemed good actions.</li>
    			<li>Questions: Should one killing result in the action to commit another killing of a rival gang member?</li>

				<ol>It would appear that given the descriptive analysis of what gang members hold to be true the answer to this question would be yes.</ol>
				<ol>That one ought to avenge the killing of a fellow gang member with the killing of a rival gang member.</ol>
				<ol>In fact, to not act in such a way can be seen as not living up to the moral expectation held in regard to the gang lifestyle.</ol>
				</ol>

	<h4>Summarization</h4>
				<li><strong>Ethical theory:</strong> Gang theory</li>
				<li><strong>Descriptive morality:</strong> Rical killing is something takin to be true</li>
				<li><strong>Normative Ethics:</strong> One ought to perform rival killing</li>
				<li><strong>Metaethics:</strong> Questions the nature of beliefs in rival killing that to the motivation to perform this act.</li>

	<h4>Evaluation</h4>
				<li> What is the point of morality</li>
				<li>This is the question raised by glaucon in Plato's republic and can be broken down into to further questions.</li>
				<ol>
				<li>Why does society need morality?</li>
				<li>Why should i be moral?</li>
				</ol>
	<h4>Why does society need morals?</h4>

				<li>To avoid and legal sanctions</li>
				<li>To avoid sanctions, being fined getting arrested, thrown in jail</li>
				<li>To live a better life while avoid living in a "state of nature" resulting in life being... Nasty, brutish, and short- Thomas hobbes</li>
				<li>Problem</li>
				<li>This only explains why an individual would want there to be some moral president that others around them followed and does not answer the second question.</li>
	<h4>Why should i be Moral</h4>

			<h4>If everyone else is acting in a moral manner why should 'I' act in the same way?</h4>
				<li>Couldn't an individual just act like they are being moral and have it work to their benefit. If Society is operating in moral way, what duty does an individuals have to just "appear" as being moral to avoid jail while stealing, plotting, and telling lies?(Remember the invisible ring)</li>
				<li>The Answer might be.... Well it is just not fair if that an individual should act in such a way if the rest of society is adhering to the 'social contract' that has been established which tells individuals how they ought to act.</li>
				<li>Bring us right back to well... why should i be moral.</li>
			<h4>So what are some of the reasons an individual would like to be?</h4>
				<li> Wrath of god- Love</li>
				<li>Financial ruin</li>
				<li>Friendship</li>

				<h3><strong>Divine Command Theory</strong></h3>

			<li>DCT-is the theory that the rightness or wrongness of an action is intrinsically related to the fact that god either commands an act to be produced or forbids an act to be produced</li>
			<h4>Lack of agreement</h4>
			<li>which god/ religious text is the authority on DCT?</li>
			<li>If there is no consensuses on the above question is it possible to find truth in DCT</li>
			<li>Can people be held accountable for their actions if they are ignorant to the teachings of a particular topic religious authority?</li>
			<li>What happens when inside a religion the authoritative text of the divine is interpreted differently by individuals?</li>
			<li>To what extend can DCT aid in the moral issues concerning the intricacies of modern day problemms with or without apposing interpretation of religious authority</li>
			<h4>Left holding the Bag</h4>
			<li>There is still a major issue concerning DCT</li>
			<li>Take this claim by DCT-Good is defined as that which god wills.</li>
			<li>Therefore, it follows that-gods will is good.</li>
			<h4>Further investigation</h4>
			<li>Does god approve of certain actions because they are good, or are certain actions good because god approves of them?</li>
			<li>First- looking at the second alternative of this question. Are certain good because god approves of them?</li>
			<li>If what good and bad are arbiter in nature.... it would apprear that god could have just as easily commanded instead that what is to considered bad is actually good.</li>
			<li>Second- Now looking at the first part of this question. Does god approve of certain action because they are good?</li>
			<li>Now it would appear that there is a rationality for god deciding what actions are good and bad.</li>
			<li>if so then we should be able to differrntiate between good and bad ourselve</li>
			<li>This would then mean that there is a concept that is independent of that which gof wills runs parrallel with god will at the same time.</li>
			<h4>Who said what?</h4>
			<li>Last (touched upon already), there remains a question that even if one was to take DCT to be true how does DCT account for individuals living a moral lnad good life that have never hear of their gods</li>
			<h2>Ethical relativism</h2>
			<h4>Ethical relativism</h4>
			<li>The position that there are no objective or universally valid moral principles</li>
			<li>All moral judgments are simply a metter of human opinion</li>
			<h4>Relativism continued</h4>
			<li>corresponds with epistemological relativism which states that there are no objective truths.</li>
			<li>However, one does not have to adopt such an epistemological view to accept the claims of objective relativism</li>
			<li>There is no objective basis for deciding what is moral and not moral, at least not in the way tjat science and math can discernable evidence.</li>
			<li>electrons, neutrons, and protons exist independently form human opnions</li>
			<li>Therefore, good and bad are not existing in the universe with declarative outside.</li>
			<h3>Subjective Ethical Relativism</h3>
			<li>States... that what is right or wrong is solely a matter of each individuals opinions</li>
			<li>Food for thought</li>
			<li>If tastes is color is a matter of opinion, and coloras are existiting....</li>
			<h3>Conventional Ethical Relativism</h3>
			<li>Convectional ethical relativism the claim that what is really right or wrong is relative to each particular society; also called ethical conventionalism</li>
			<h4>Ethical objectivism</h4>
			<li>The position that certain moral proinciples are universal (they apply to all persons in all times) and objective (they are not based on the opinions of individuals or cultures).</li>
			<li>Meaning that there are objectively true and false to ethical questions... like math</li>
			<h3>Absolutism </h3>
			<li>The claim that not only are moral principles objectives, but also they cannot be overridden and there cannot be any expceptions to them.</li>
			<li>Absolutism is a narrowed position of objectivism and can be considered a subcatergory of within it.</li>
			<li>Hence, all absolutism are objectivists, but the reverse is not true.</li>
			<li>Does this sound familiar.</li>
			<h4>Two soverign masters, Pleasure and Pain</h4>
			<li>Understanding the Principle of Utility.464-465p</li>
			<h4>Bentham's Calculus</h4>
			<li>Benthams "Hedonic Calculus"</li>
			<li>Pleasure is the onlu thing that has value</li>
			<li>Therefore, an action that maximizes the most possible pleasure is the best action</li>
			<h4>Calculus continued</h4>
			<ol>Intensity:</ol>
			<li>How strong is the pleasure?</li>
			<ol>Duration:</ol>
			<li>How long will the pleasure last</li>
			<ol>Certainty or Uncertainty:</ol>
			<li>How likely or unlikely is is that the pleasure will occur</li>
			<h4>Pleasure-Pain=...</h4>
			<ol>For each person affected by a proposed action, add up the total units of pleasure produces and subtract the units of pain</ol>
			<ol>Merge the calculations for each individual into the sum total of pleasure and pain produced for the community.</ol>
			<ol>Do this calculation for alternative courses of action.</ol>
			<h4>Points</h4>
			<li>Notice there has been no discussion of what specifically has value.</li>
			<li>The principle of utility provides an objective moral value(pleasure should be sought while pain is to be avoided) there is no absolute standard of value.Leaving value tobe relative and subjective.</li>
			<li>Bentham makes morality as easy as preparing a balance sheet. Is Ethics that easy.</li>
			<li>Bentham appears to be a Phycological hedonist, motivated by peasure seeking.</li>
			<li>This differs from the ethical egoist since Bentham States the principle of utility should be used to serve our own self-interest, but rather used to produce the greatest happiness for society. In doing so, we can legislate and create the best society for everyone.</li>
			<h4>Just milling around</h4>
			<li>John Stuart Mill</li>
			<li>Accepting of the main outline of Bentham's Hedonictic Claim that hapiness is the absense of pain.</li>
			<h1>Kants Deontology</h1>
			<h4>BEcause reason is the reason</h4>
			<li>You guessed it Kant is attempting to base Ethics in a struchture which is in the same vain as math and logic</li>
			<li>Kant comes before benthan and mill</li>
			<li>Most important is an individuals will behind the action</li>
			<li>Attempts to capture a moral Law that is absolute and unchanging</li>
			<li>Moral law is binding the gravity thinking does not apply to a sityation or an individuals is irrational 2+3=5 no matter what imagining that it is something else impossible</li>
			<li>Act only on mxim that is able to be concieved and also made into a universal LAw- constancy with rational though</li>
			<li>The pull of duty</li>
			<li>shop keeper example* motivation is Key</li>
			<li>Acting in accordance with duty- external behavior with what ought to be performed to be moral</li>
			<li>Acting from duty- The desire to perform behavior with what ought to be performed to be moral</li>
			<li>Acting from duty- The desire to perform and act because it is moral</li>
			<li>Good will- the onlything in the world that has absolute, unqualified moral value... and it would shine like a gem</li>
			<li>The uninterested Spectator would be able to see this good will "shinning like a gem"</li>
			<h4>Deontology</h4>
			<li>Kantian Ethics- The Theory that the have absolute moral duties that are determined by reason and that are not affected by the consequences.</li>
			<li>Hypothetical  Imperative-A command of reason taking place under the hypothesis that an individual desires something</li>
			<li>If you want X do Y</li>
			<li>X is the end goal where Y why is the means</li>
			<h4>Categorical Imperative-Dictates what one ought to do in the form of DO X</h4>
			<h4>The starry Heavens Above me and the moral law within me</h4>
			<li>Once we perform an action the casual chain is vast and difficult to follow, therefore is does ot seem to rational to judge morality from the consequesnce of acts</li>
			<li>Ultimately the pull to act of duty and the moral law is only accessible from inline an individual through good will</li>
			<li>Maxim- A Maxim is a subjective rule on which an individual actually acts as opposed to an objective principle upon which one should act.</li>
			<h4>Categorial Imperative 2: Personal as Ends in Themselves</h4>
			<li>Every rational being exists as an end in himself and not merely as a means to be arbitrarily used by this or that will.</li>
			<li>Things only have a value if a individuals endow them with value.</li>
			<li>Humans on the other hand are the source of conditional Value</li>
			<li>Maxim = one is to never treat another human merely as a mean to an end since they are an end in themselves</li>
