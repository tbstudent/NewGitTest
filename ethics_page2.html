				<h1>Ethics Continued Hombre</h1>



			<h4> Prima Facia Duty</h4>
			<ol>
					<li>Fidelity: Keeping your promise, truth the truth</li>
					<li>Reparation: Compensating other for the wrongs youhave done.</li>
					<li>Gratitude: Showing appreciation for benefits others have bestowed on us.</li>
					<li>Justice: distrubuting good with impartially and equity.</li>
					<li>Beneficence: Promoting other peoples good </li>
					
					<h4>Social contract Theory</h4>
					<li>]The theory that the justification of a government and its exercise of power is based on an explicit or implicit agreement made between the indivuals who live under that government or between the citizens and the government.</li>
					<li>So what is social contract theory? do individuals loose or gain anything with the entry into the contract? how would lock and hobbes answer? Social contract theory attempts to answers the question of how government arose, why government has the right to impose laws on individuals, and in some ways is an attempt to legitimizes government.</li>
					<li>But is this always the case?</li>
					<li>What contract? I didn't put my signature on anything...</li>
					<li>If you are like most individuals than you probabble never had an oppotunity to actually forma government from conception; nor hace you ever had the opportunity to sign a document like the declation of independence and construct the constitution like thomas Jefferson....</li>
					<li> Which seems like this could potentially be a problem</li>
					<li> Social contract theorist believe that as long as you are born in and live in a country you are both privy and subject to the laws of that laws of that land.</li>
					<li>When you are an adult you can choose to leave or stay in said country.</li>
					<li>Regardless if you decide to stayor leace to live in another country. By either remaining or seeking out new citizenship from another country, you have tacitly agreed to recognize the liegitimacy of the stae and its power you have decided to take residency in countries laws and regulations</li>
					<li>Of course Legitimacy and justification of state power equvocal and most certainty can be discussed in futher detail.</li>

					</ol>
					<h4>Definitions</h4>

					<li>State of Nature: The Nature condition of mankind existing in the world. A time without an organized statte/ Government/ society</li>

					<li>Right: An established legal claim which grants an individual the permission/ privilege to execute a particualr action(s) while simultaneously obliging all others in a given society to acknnowledge, and therefor, not inhibit the privilidges which have been granted0</li>
					<h4>Thomas Hobbes:</h4>
					<li> Still believed the best form of government was a monarchy.But a monarch that receives the right to rule from the people NOT god.</li>
					<li>Held a pessimistic view of man existing in a state of  Nature.</li>
					<li>Hobbes does not have Faith in humanity. In fact, Given the opportunity. Humans will tend o act selfish and depraved</li>
					<li>If this not true and humans can be trusted, ask yourself why it is that you lock your doors at night?</li>
					<li>Basically why would i listen to any one about telling me what to do.</li>
					<h4>Thomas Hobbes 2</h4>
					<li>In all , govenrments are built out of a ration fear of ourselves, construct of man which knowingly constructs an artificial body (The leviantan ) constructed from, and by the commonwealth's Social contract and given a soulof sorts known as (Soverign Power).</li>
					<h4></h4>
					<h4>Definitions</h4>
					<li>Dialectic: A discussion, a discourse taking place concerning the investigation of the truth of opinion.</li>
					<li>Capital: That which has an exchange value of economic wealth, money property, goods</li>
					<li>Capitalism:A political and ecoonomic system where the means of production are privately controlled</li>
					<li>Labor:We transform nature in order to satisfy our needs unalienated productive activity which express out capscity for collective transformation of nature to satisfy our needs and wants</li>
					<li>Fetishism:Granting mystical powers over inanimate objects or phenomena, in this case pertaining to commodities</li>
					<li>Entfremdung/ alienation:Estrangement, a condition where workers in a capitalist economy, are unable to identify themselves in the products of their labor produces.</li>
					<h4>Marx in five points</h4>
					<li>Economics rules everything</li>
					<li>Class struggle throughtout history is constant</li>
					<li>Capitalism survives by the exploitation of the worker</li>
					<li>History is a deterministic dialectic process</li>
					<li>Capitalism will inevitably lead to its own undoing</li>
					<h4>Economics Rules Everything</h4>
					<li>Through this idea of the dialectiv, Marx claims that the natural progression of human behavior is centered around the economy and human relation to labor.</li>
					<li>Before you are capable to do anything elseyou must be able to survive 	another day.</li>
					<li>that survive one needs, food shelder, clothes.</li>
					<li>So.... Before anything else we must survive- then come maths and philoshopy, and art</li>
					<li>Because of this all changes that take plce in a society is the direct result of the economy.</li>
					<li>However, who is controlling the force that inevitable leads to the changes in our society.</li>
					<li>Super structure</li>
					<li>Since society and culture are the direct result of the economy philophical ideas and the like are either suppported or stamped fdown according to if the idea either supports or goes against the rulling power structure.</li>
					<li>"The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas.... the class which has the means of production at its disposal, has control at the same time over the means of mental production."Marx</li>
					<li>Therefo, at any point in time one can see the influence of power that the rulling class has had over society in art, philoshopy , science manufacturing....</li>
					<li>Ironically, or maybe not... Marx did not work much himself, but he was financed by his friend engels and others.</li>
					<h4>Religion:</h4>
					<li>Hence, marx rejects religion and conddemns it as being the opium of the people</li>
					<li>Religion teaches the working class that it is noble to suffer under the conditions they live in, rather than take up against the power that is crushing them</li>
					<li>Therefor, religion itself is an expression of the economic structure.</li>
